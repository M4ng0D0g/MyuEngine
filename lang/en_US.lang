# MyuEngine English Language File
# Format: key=translation
# Lines starting with # are comments, blank lines are ignored
# For English, most keys map to themselves — only entries that
# differ from the key need to be listed here.  The engine falls
# back to the key when no entry is found, so this file can stay
# mostly empty.  It is provided for completeness and as a
# template for new translations.
